    <h2>Explanations</h2>
    <p>How the Game Works</p>
    The game board consist of a grid of sixteen cards. These sixteen cards
    are, in fact, eight different pairs of cards. "The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down."

    <p>Gameplay rules</p>
    Flip over thwo hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
    <strong>Each turn:</strong>

    <ol>
      <li>"The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol."</li>
      <li>"The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol."</li>
      <li>"If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over."</li>
      <li>"If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down."</li>
    </ol>

    The games end once all cards have been correctly matched.
