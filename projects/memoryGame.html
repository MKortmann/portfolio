      <h2>Explanations</h2>
          <p>How the Game Works</p>
          The game board consist of a grid of sixteen cards. These sixteen cards
          are, in fact, eight different pairs of cards. "The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down."

          <p>Gameplay rules</p>
          Flip over thwo hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
          <strong>Each turn:</strong>

          <ol>
            <li>"The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol."</li>
            <li>"The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol."</li>
            <li>"If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over."</li>
            <li>"If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down."</li>
          </ol>

          The games end once all cards have been correctly matched.
